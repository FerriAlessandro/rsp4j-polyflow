# Stream Processing Library for Java (RSP4J)


In this repository, the following projects are present:

* [API](./api/Readme.md), which contains the interfaces and abstractions required to develop your stream processor engine.
* [polyflow](./polyflow/README.md), which contains some reference implementations that aims at showing the API usage by providing examples (Currently a relational and a graph example)
